## All the definitions are according to wikipedia

### VO (Value Object)
- In computer science, a value object is a small object that represents a simple entity whose equality is not based on identity: i.e. two value objects are equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being the same object. 

	```java
	public class PersonVO
	{
		private final String name;
		private final int age;
		public PersonVO(String name, int age) {
			this.name = name;
			this.age = age;
		}
		public String getName()
		{
			return name;
		}

		public int getAge()
		{
			return age;
		}
		public boolean equals (PersonVO vo) {
			return this.name === vo.name && this.age === vo.age;
		}
	}
	```

### DTO (Data Transfer Object)
- In the field of programming a data transfer object  is an object that carries data between processes. The motivation for its use is that communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces (e.g., web services), where each call is an expensive operation

- DTOs are simple objects that should not contain any business logic but may contain serialization and deserialization mechanisms for transferring data over the wire.
	
	```java
	public class PersonDTO
	{
		public String name;
		public int age;
		public PersonDTO(String name, int age) {
			this.name = name;
			this.age = age;
		}
		public String getName()
		{
			return name;
		}

		public void setName(String name)
		{
			this.name = name;
		}

		public int getAge()
		{
			return age;
		}

		public int setAge(int age)
		{
			this.age = age;
		}
	}
	```
	
### DAO (Data Access Object)
- In computer software, a data access object (DAO) is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing details of the database.

	```java
	public class PersonDAO
	{
		private Database db;
		private String name;
		private int age;

		public void addUser()
		{
			PersonVO personVO =new PersonVO("sinikami",2);
			db.insert(personVO);
		}

	}
	```
