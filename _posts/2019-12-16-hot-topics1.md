Kristen Sorensen was 55 when she became `paralyzed` from the neck down last year.

“It came out of nowhere,” says Sorensen. “I’d been fine and exercising every day, but it just started with `tingling` in my fingertips then progressed.”

Diagnosed in October 2018 with Guillain Barre `syndrome`, a rare disorder that affects the body’s nervous system, she never expected to walk again.

But earlier that year, the Brooks Cybernic Treatment Center in Jacksonville, Florida, became the first US center to use a unique rehabilitative technology developed in Japan — the Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL).


HAL — essentially a wearable cyborg — helps those with `spinal cord` injuries and muscular `dystrophy` regain their movements and strengthen their nerves and muscles. Known as `exoskeletons`, they’re a type of lightweight suit, with joints powered by small electric motors, that serve as mechanical muscle.

Here’s what’s truly `mind-blowing`: Patients use their brain waves to control them.

When Sorensen heard about the brain wave-controlled exoskeleton, which was developed by Japanese roboticist Yoshiyuki Sankai, she knew she had to give it a try. She was determined to walk at her daughter’s wedding a few months later in December.

But it’s not just those with disabilities or injuries who stand to benefit. By 2050, there will be more than 2 billion people over age 60, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and exoskeletons could offer a solution to the world’s aging population.

In the future, as human bodies wear down with age, an exoskeleton — powered by active minds — could help people stay on their feet. But you can’t just put on HAL and expect to be sprinting in seconds. 

Rehabilitation requires time, determination and the help of a physiotherapist and a body weight harness that ensures patients are supported and kept `upright` while they use HAL on a treadmill.

Sorensen says it initially felt like HAL was doing most of the work by helping `induce` her muscles to make small leg movements that mimic natural walking patterns, but then she found herself increasingly `in the driving seat`.

Currently, Sankai’s exoskeletons are helping patients restore their muscle movements in Japan, the Philippines and in Germany and Poland.Previously robotic-assistance tech centered on military use. But these days, HAL is part of a wave of research that focuses on using exoskeleton tech to treat ailments or provide support to wearers. 

For example, researchers at Harvard `unveiled` a soft exosuit in 2014 that enhances a patient’s strength, much like HAL. And automobile makers like Ford are using exoskeletons on factory floors to reduce worker `fatigue`. HAL, too, has potential beyond the medical field, with everything from rescue and support and labor intensive factory work to entertainment and elderly care.
