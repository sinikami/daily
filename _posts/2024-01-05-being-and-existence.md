Before delving into the concept of Monad, we need to clarify what existence is.

Existence can be categorized as:

- Existence with substance (entities with substance)
- Existence without substance, which can be referred to as "being"


Existence without substance refers to the existence of something that exists but has not been observed. Conversely, the inability to observe something does not necessarily imply its non-existence. Existence with substance refers to objectively existing entities that are simultaneously observable.

Let's imagine, from the perspective of an observer, observing the universe in a higher dimension. If something possesses its own identity but is not observed by an observer, we can label it as a Monoid. A Monoid is an independent existence without any established connections to surrounding entities.

So, what is a Monad?

Before delving into a detailed explanation of Monad, let's first become acquainted with what `Category theory` is.

> a collection of "objects" that are linked by "arrows"


To illustrate, picture the stars in the night sky. If we consider these stars as points on a plane and connect any two points with an arrow, we call it a `Category`. In this context, each point with identity is referred to as a monoid.

The representation of relationships between Categories is termed a Map. Only when we truly understand Maps can we comprehend Monads.
